## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Rich purple (#6A4C93) to create a grounded feeling, referencing royalty and wisdom.
- Background color: Light lavender (#E6E0ED), a very desaturated version of the primary.
- Accent color: Blue (#4C6A93), an analogous color on the left side of purple, is significantly different in both brightness and saturation to create good contrast.
- Headline font: 'Belleza' (sans-serif) for headlines and short chunks of text; for longer text choose 'Alegreya' (serif) for body text.
- Use minimalist icons that represent the quote categories and achievement badges.
- Clean, uncluttered interface with a clear visual hierarchy and one primary action per screen.
- Subtle animations and transitions to provide feedback and enhance the user experience, such as a progress bar completing as each reflection is saved.
